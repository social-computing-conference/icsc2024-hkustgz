                of online text, learn the ability to reproduce the perspectives and linguistic styles of diverse social
                and cultural groups. This capability suggests a powerful social scientific application – the simulation
                of empirically realistic, culturally situated human subjects. Synthesizing recent research in artificial
                intelligence and computational social science, we outline a methodological foundation for simulating
                human subjects and their social interactions. We then identify nine characteristics of current models
                that are likely to impair realistic simulation human subjects, including atemporality, social
                acceptability bias, uniformity, and poverty of sensory experience. For each of these areas, we discuss
                promising approaches for overcoming their associated shortcomings. Given the rate of change of these
                models, we advocate for an ongoing methodological program on the simulation of human subjects that keeps
                pace with rapid technical progress.

                <b class="blue">Abstract:</b> The structure of data organization is widely recognized as having a
                substantial influence on the efficacy of machine learning algorithms, particularly in binary
                classification tasks. Our research provides a theoretical framework suggesting that the maximum
                potential of binary classifiers on a given dataset is primarily constrained by the inherent qualities of
                the data. Through both theoretical reasoning and empirical examination, we employed standard objective
                functions, evaluative metrics, and binary classifiers to arrive at two principal conclusions. Firstly,
                we show that the theoretical upper bound of binary classification performance on actual datasets can be
                theoretically attained. This upper boundary represents a calculable equilibrium between the learning
                loss and the metric of evaluation. Secondly, we have computed the precise upper bounds for three
                commonly used evaluation metrics, uncovering a fundamental uniformity with our overarching thesis: the
                upper bound is intricately linked to the dataset's characteristics, independent of the classifier in
                use. Additionally, our subsequent analysis uncovers a detailed relationship between the upper limit of
                performance and the level of class overlap within the binary classification data. This relationship is
                instrumental for pinpointing the most effective feature subsets for use in feature engineering. This
                work is generally has potential applications in data driven researches to quantitively evaluate the
                dilemma of promoting algorithm performance and improving data quality.

                <b class="blue">Abstract:</b> Corporate fraud detection aims to automatically recognize companies that
                conduct wrongful activities such as fraudulent financial statements or illegal insider trading. Previous
                learning-based methods fail to effectively integrate rich interactions in the company network. To close
                this gap, we collect 18-year financial records in China to form three graph datasets with fraud labels.
                We analyze the characteristics of the financial graphs, highlighting two pronounced issues: (1)
                information overload: the dominance of (noisy) non-company nodes over company nodes hinders the
                message-passing process in Graph Convolution Networks (GCN); and (2) hidden fraud: there exists a large
                percentage of possible undetected violations in the collected data. The hidden fraud problem will
                introduce noisy labels in the training dataset and compromise fraud detection results. To handle such
                challenges, we introduce a novel graph-based method, namely, Knowledge-enhanced GCN with Robust
                Two-stage Learning (KeGCNR), which leverages Knowledge Graph Embeddings to mitigate the information
                overload and effectively learns rich representations.

                infrastructure without centralised ownership or control. They do, however, raise several key systems
                challenges, particularly related to scaling-up common machine learning driven features. One particularly
                challenging machine learning task is content moderation, i.e. the ability to detect and remove content
                that breaches the policies of the social networking platform (e.g. hate speech). In traditional
                platforms (e.g. Twitter), this is done by training large machine learning models that can automatically
                detect harmful content. However, in Decentralized Social Networks (like Mastodon), this is impossible as
                there is no single point that can aggregate data and train models. This talk will discuss recent work
                evaluating and building Decentralized Social Networking moderation tools, focusing on the challenges
                encountered in-the-wild. The presentation is based on several papers recently published at SIGCOMM,
                SIGMETRCS, IMC, and WWW.

                on this aspect by characterizing the information flow into organizations, primarily business firms. We
                measure online reading using a large data set of articles accessed by employees across millions of
                firms. We measure and relate quantitatively three aspects: reading volume, variety, and firm size. We
                compare volume with size, showing that firm sizes grow sublinearly with reading volume. This is like an
                economy of scale in information consumption that exaggerates the classic Zipf's law inequality for firm
                economics. We connect variety and volume to show that reading variety is limited. Firms above a
                threshold size read repetitively, consistent with the onset of a coordination problem between teams of
                employees in a simple model. Finally, we relate reading variety to size. The relationship is consistent
                with large firms that accumulate interests as they grow. We argue that this reflects structural
                constraints. Taking the scaling relations as a baseline, we show that excess reading is strongly
                correlated with returns and valuations. The results indicate how information consumption reflects
                internal structure, beyond individual employees, as is important for collective information processing
                in other systems.

                physical, social, and cyber dimensions of cities are increasingly integrated. This has led to the
                emergence of various intelligent applications, which, through continuous interaction with people, have
                created numerous new use cases. Meanwhile, it has introduced new problems, risks, and challenges for the
                future development of human settlements. This report explores the definition and fundamental functions
                of urban intelligence, and, in light of research topics, introduces typical use cases and future trends
                of urban intelligence. The increasingly information offers new opportunities for scientifically
                understanding the complex urban systems. Urban intelligence, by integrating data resources and
                artificial intelligence, fully utilizes multi-source heterogeneous data across different spatial scales
                and temporal frequencies to promote synergy between various subsystems and domains, aiming to support
                more responsive, precise, and forward-looking planning and operation. Urban intelligence will also help
                scientifically understand the nonlinear relationships between ecological, economic, and social factors
                related to human habitation, providing support for the coordinated digital transformation and urban
                management. In response to the challenges posed by the rapid emergence of information technology, such
                as data silos, information overload, disorderly development, and technological ethics, the report
                further discusses the guiding significance of planning in the development and utilization of urban
                information technology, as well as the basic principles that urban intelligence should follow. Looking
                forward, urban intelligence will provide scientific approaches and technical solutions for sustainable
                cities, and it will also become an important driving force for new productive capacities and
                high-quality urban development.

                <b class="blue">Abstract:</b> What can we learn about the structure of the mind, both human and
                artificial, using large-scale social data, such as the textual and visual data flowing through search
                engines and social media platforms? In this keynote, I present a diverse range of studies showing how
                large-scale social data online can serve as a sociocognitive observatory for measuring the structure of
                both individual and collective minds, ranging from the structure of embodied cognition to the
                psychological biases that drive the formation of stereotypes. I will give special attention to
                presenting the results of a study we recently published in Nature which demonstrates how combining
                large-scale image and text data from online sources, analyzed via artificial intelligence, can reveal
                the multimodal structure of gender stereotypes. I will then show how these methods can further identify
                the cognitive structure of multidimensional stereotypes (e.g., gendered ageism) not only in human minds,
                but also in the representations and judgments formed by generative AI. Throughout, I will emphasize that
                sociocognitive observatories are useful not only for testing existing theories, but also for enabling
                cognitive and cultural discoveries. As an example, I will discuss ongoing work that harnesses
                sociocognitive observatories to unveil hidden connections between the cognitive structure of
                social types (e.g., gender) and the concreteness and abstractness of concepts across domains, using both
                textual and visual data online, as well as large-scale human crowdsourcing and the representational
                embeddings of large language models. The ability to measure and predict the evolution of such cognitive
                structure using real-time online data streams naturally raises the question of how AI can leverage such
                insights to augment collective intelligence and creativity. Opportunities for augmentation, which become
                increasingly accessible through the integration of computer science, cognitive science, and cultural
                sociology, will be discussed.

                How can we navigate these societies without social life descending into conflict and chaos? Scholars
                since antiquity have primarily pointed to societal institutions like legal codes and moralizing
                religions for enforcing and coordinating large-scale cooperation. Here, I will focus on the overlooked
                role of social psychological heuristics that help people infer their partners’ cooperative intent,
                priorities, and abilities. Concepts like “morality,” traits like “agreeableness,” and social identities
                like “Canadian” are all inference heuristics that help us use known information to predict the contents
                of unknown minds. I suggest that these heuristics are more widespread than previously acknowledged, and
                became especially pervasive as societies became larger and more diverse. I will present converging
                research streams supporting the rise of these social heuristics in
                large-scale societies. First, field studies of Hadza hunter-gatherers, cross-cultural survey data, and
                natural language processing (NLP) analyses of historical English literature document the emergence of
                broad, generalized traits connoting morality and warmth in modern language and social cognition. Second,
                NLP analyses of social media communities, ethnographic analyses of non-industrial societies, and
                large-scale NLP analyses of Chinese historical records show that social identities become more salient
                and affectively polarized as groups become larger. I will conclude by suggesting that social
                psychological phenomena such as traits, social identities, and even values function as linguistically
                embedded and transmitted heuristics that act as inference tools for navigating partner selection in
                large-scale groups.

                'random state' in algorithmic pipelines. However, in the process of doing so, we argue that researchers
                index into the scientific record an insurmountable number of outcomes with seeming certainty, when they
                are in fact anything but certain: eliminating this variation is the opposite of what responsible
                researchers and practitioners should be doing. PNRGs are almost ubiquitous in some research areas --
                occurring in a large proportion of quantitative and computational research designs -- and the potential
                variation in the estimand or outcome of interest is hitherto significantly under-appreciated. We present

                computational health and social sciences. We show just how large the variation caused by the
                instantiation of PRNGs can be. We conclude with recommendations on how to embrace this variation for the
                betterment of scientific society, and how to responsibly design research which legitimately reduces and
                visualizes it where possible.

                maintaining a credible cyberspace. Although features from the content and propagation topology are
                widely exploited by existing studies to distinguish disinformation from normal ones, they are becoming
                less effective as content can be intentionally written to mislead readers and topological features are
                difficult to be extracted due to the high variance and diversity of reposting trees. Moreover, related
                works mainly focus on modeling the complete information propagation event, ignoring the staged evolution
                patterns along with propagation, which may also degrade the detection performance. In this paper, we
                conceive and implement a novel framework called DMPS for identifying disinformation, which dynamically
                models diverse topological structures of reposting trees as well as the textual content streams across
                different propagation stages. Particularly, DMPS learns expressive representations of the structural
                features via meta-trees and extracts sequential features of the content for intra-stage modeling, then
                it captures temporal dependencies for inter-stage modeling. The whole framework is optimized in a binary
                classification manner. Experiments based on multilingual social media datasets validate the
                effectiveness and superiority of DMPS over state-of-the-art models. We believe that this study can
                provide insights for crisis management in response to disinformation in social network campaigns.
