    <h2>Conference Overview</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <strong> 2024 International Conference of Social Computing (ICSC 2024) will be held at the Hong Kong University
            of
            Science and
            Technology (Guangzhou) from August 30 to 31, 2024.</strong> The conference is jointly organized by the Urban
        Governance
        and Design
        Thrust (UGOD) of the Society Hub at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) and the
        National Laboratory
        for Computational Social Science and Governance at Tsinghua University. <strong>theme of the conference is "AI,
            Human and Cities."</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Social Computing emerged from the significant advancements in complex evolutionary research facilitated by big
        data and artificial
        intelligence methodologies. It encompasses a range of techniques, from dynamic modeling, computer simulation,
        and complex network
        analysis to the construction of predictive models using machine learning and deep learning algorithms, the
        application of explainable
        AI to uncover theoretical insights, and the use of various algorithms to measure variables and validate
        theoretical models.
        The integration of these methods with big data and social science theories has given rise to a new field: Social
        Computing.
        Social Computing revolves around two core concepts: computation and sociality, which mutually promote and
        inspire each other.
        On the one hand, Social Computing focuses on how social research can contribute to computational research, such
        as social software design
        and social network recommendation algorithms. On the other hand, it explores how computational research can
        enhance social research,
        examining the developments brought about by the introduction of new data and methods into social science
        research.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The International Conference on Social Computing (ICSC) originated in 2016 from the "Network Analysis of Online
        Behavior Chicago-Tsinghua Conference"
        jointly organized by the Social Network Research Center at Tsinghua University and the University of Chicago
        Booth School of Business.
        In 2017, the conference hosted the annual meeting of the International Network for Social Network Analysis
        (SUNBELT) while also incorporating
        an online behavior agenda. In 2018, it was officially renamed the first International Conference of Social
        Computing and established the English
        journal Journal of Social Computing (JoSoCo), expanding the original academic circle centered on online behavior
        and complex network analysis.
        It brought together a group of domestic and international scholars interested in Social Computing, organizing
        annual conferences, establishing
        its own journal, and occasionally hosting lectures and providing training opportunities to broaden the influence
        of the domestic and international
        Social Computing field. Since then, the conference has been held annually (with one year canceled due to the
        pandemic).
