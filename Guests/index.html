    <p class="bio-details">The conference will be conducted in English. We have invited a number of renowned experts and
        scholars from both
        domestic and international institutions to participate in paper presentations and discussions. The invited
        scholars include:</p>

            <p class="institution">Department of Sociology, University of Chicago, USA</p>
            <p><b>Bio: </b>Dr. Evans is the Director of the Knowledge Lab, a Fellow in the Computation Institute, and
                the Co-Director for the Masters in Computational Social Science Program. In addition to his leadership
                duties, Dr. Evans is a Max Palevsky Professor in Sociology with research that focuses on the collective
                system of thinking and knowing, ranging from the distribution of attention and intuition, the origin of
                ideas and shared habits of reasoning to processes of agreement (and dispute), accumulation of certainty
                (and doubt), and the texture—novelty, ambiguity, topology—of human understanding. He is especially
                interested in innovation—how new ideas and practices emerge—and the role that social and technical
                institutions (e.g., the Internet, markets, collaborations) play in collective cognition and discovery.
